🧠 In Other Words — A Language Thinking Game

In Other Words is a vocabulary-based language game inspired by the classic game Taboo.
It challenges your ability to express ideas without using specific words — a core skill in mastering any language.

🎯 The Idea Behind the Game

One hallmark of true language fluency is being able to express what you mean — even when the exact word escapes you.
When learning a new language, you often face moments where you don’t know a specific term or lack a close synonym. This game is designed to strengthen that very skill: the ability to communicate fluidly and flexibly, even with limited vocabulary.

By avoiding certain “forbidden words” and describing the target word using clues or related ideas, players practice creative thinking, paraphrasing, and linguistic adaptability — all in a fun and interactive way.

🕹️ How to Play

Choose your difficulty level.

You’ll receive a target word (in English) and a list of forbidden words (in Spanish (words you can’t use in your hints).

Give hints (in Spanish) to help the AI guess your word — without saying or using any of the forbidden terms or their variations.

The AI will make guesses based on your hints.

You win when the AI correctly identifies the correct translation of your word within the allowed number of tries!

🚧 Work in Progress

This project is actively in development.
I’m currently refining:

🗂️ The word bank and forbidden word lists for more balanced and nuanced gameplay.

🤖 The AI logic and embedding models for improved word detection and semantic accuracy.

🎨 User experience and animations for smoother, more intuitive play.

Expect ongoing improvements and tuning as the game evolves!
